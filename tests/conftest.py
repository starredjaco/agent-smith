"""
Shared fixtures for the agent-smith test suite.

Key concerns handled here:
- core.cost and core.session use module-level mutable globals — reset between tests.
- core.findings writes to a hardcoded findings.json path — redirect to tmp_path.
- core.findings._lock is an asyncio.Lock() — recreate per test to avoid cross-loop issues.
- File writes from cost/session modules are redirected to tmp_path so the repo root stays clean.
